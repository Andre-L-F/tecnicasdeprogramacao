Yellow, black.&#xa;Yellow, black. Yellow, black.&#xa;Ooh, black and yellow!&#xa;Let&apos;s shake it up a little.&#xa;Barry! Breakfast is ready!&#xa;Ooming!&#xa;Hang on a second.&#xa;Hello?&#xa;- Barry?&#xa;- Adam?&#xa;- Oan you believe this is happening?&#xa;- I can&apos;t. I&apos;ll pick you up.&#xa;Looking sharp.&#xa;Use the stairs. Your father&#xa;paid good money for those.&#xa;Sorry. I&apos;m excited.&#xa;Here&apos;s the graduate.&#xa;We&apos;re very proud of you, son.&#xa;A perfect report card, all B&apos;s.&#xa;Very proud.&#xa;Ma! I got a thing going here.&#xa;- You got lint on your fuzz.&#xa;- Ow! That&apos;s me!&#xa;- Wave to us! We&apos;ll be in row 118,000.&#xa;- Bye!&#xa;Barry, I told you,&#xa;stop flying in the house!&#xa;- Hey, Adam.&#xa;- Hey, Barry.&#xa;- Is that fuzz gel?&#xa;- A little. Special day, graduation.&#xa;Never thought I&apos;d make it.&#xa;Three days grade school,&#xa;three days high school.&#xa;Those were awkward.&#xa;Three days college. I&apos;m glad I took&#xa;a day and hitchhiked around the hive.&#xa;You did come back different.&#xa;- Hi, Barry.&#xa;- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.&#xa;- Hear about Frankie?&#xa;- Yeah.&#xa;- You going to the funeral?&#xa;- No, I&apos;m not going.&#xa;Everybody knows,&#xa;sting someone, you die.&#xa;Don&apos;t waste it on a squirrel.&#xa;Such a hothead.&#xa;I guess he could have&#xa;just gotten out of the way.&#xa;I love this incorporating&#xa;an amusement park into our day.&#xa;That&apos;s why we don&apos;t need vacations.&#xa;Boy, quite a bit of pomp...&#xa;under the circumstances.&#xa;- Well, Adam, today we are men.&#xa;- We are!&#xa;- Bee-men.&#xa;- Amen!&#xa;Hallelujah!&#xa;Students, faculty, distinguished bees,&#xa;please welcome Dean Buzzwell.&#xa;Welcome, New Hive Oity&#xa;graduating class of...&#xa;...9:15.&#xa;That concludes our ceremonies.&#xa;And begins your career&#xa;at Honex Industries!&#xa;Will we pick ourjob today?&#xa;I heard it&apos;s just orientation.&#xa;Heads up! Here we go.&#xa;Keep your hands and antennas&#xa;inside the tram at all times.&#xa;- Wonder what it&apos;ll be like?&#xa;- A little scary.&#xa;Welcome to Honex,&#xa;a division of Honesco&#xa;and a part of the Hexagon Group.&#xa;This is it!&#xa;Wow.&#xa;Wow.&#xa;We know that you, as a bee,&#xa;have worked your whole life&#xa;to get to the point where you&#xa;can work for your whole life.&#xa;Honey begins when our valiant Pollen&#xa;Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.&#xa;Our top-secret formula&#xa;is automatically color-corrected,&#xa;scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured&#xa;into this soothing sweet syrup&#xa;with its distinctive&#xa;golden glow you know as...&#xa;Honey!&#xa;- That girl was hot.&#xa;- She&apos;s my cousin!&#xa;- She is?&#xa;- Yes, we&apos;re all cousins.&#xa;- Right. You&apos;re right.&#xa;- At Honex, we constantly strive&#xa;to improve every aspect&#xa;of bee existence.&#xa;These bees are stress-testing&#xa;a new helmet technology.&#xa;- What do you think he makes?&#xa;- Not enough.&#xa;Here we have our latest advancement,&#xa;the Krelman.&#xa;- What does that do?&#xa;- Oatches that little strand of honey&#xa;that hangs after you pour it.&#xa;Saves us millions.&#xa;Oan anyone work on the Krelman?&#xa;Of course. Most bee jobs are&#xa;small ones. But bees know&#xa;that every small job,&#xa;if it&apos;s done well, means a lot.&#xa;But choose carefully&#xa;because you&apos;ll stay in the job&#xa;you pick for the rest of your life.&#xa;The same job the rest of your life?&#xa;I didn&apos;t know that.&#xa;What&apos;s the difference?&#xa;You&apos;ll be happy to know that bees,&#xa;as a species, haven&apos;t had one day off&#xa;in 27 million years.&#xa;So you&apos;ll just work us to death?&#xa;We&apos;ll sure try.&#xa;Wow! That blew my mind!&#xa;&quot;What&apos;s the difference?&quot;&#xa;How can you say that?&#xa;One job forever?&#xa;That&apos;s an insane choice to have to make.&#xa;I&apos;m relieved. Now we only have&#xa;to make one decision in life.&#xa;But, Adam, how could they&#xa;never have told us that?&#xa;Why would you question anything?&#xa;We&apos;re bees.&#xa;We&apos;re the most perfectly&#xa;functioning society on Earth.&#xa;You ever think maybe things&#xa;work a little too well here?&#xa;Like what? Give me one example.&#xa;I don&apos;t know. But you know&#xa;what I&apos;m talking about.&#xa;Please clear the gate.&#xa;Royal Nectar Force on approach.&#xa;Wait a second. Oheck it out.&#xa;- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!&#xa;- Wow.&#xa;I&apos;ve never seen them this close.&#xa;They know what it&apos;s like&#xa;outside the hive.&#xa;Yeah, but some don&apos;t come back.&#xa;- Hey, Jocks!&#xa;- Hi, Jocks!&#xa;You guys did great!&#xa;You&apos;re monsters!&#xa;You&apos;re sky freaks! I love it! I love it!&#xa;- I wonder where they were.&#xa;- I don&apos;t know.&#xa;Their day&apos;s not planned.&#xa;Outside the hive, flying who knows&#xa;where, doing who knows what.&#xa;You can&apos;tjust decide to be a Pollen&#xa;Jock. You have to be bred for that.&#xa;Right.&#xa;Look. That&apos;s more pollen&#xa;than you and I will see in a lifetime.&#xa;It&apos;s just a status symbol.&#xa;Bees make too much of it.&#xa;Perhaps. Unless you&apos;re wearing it&#xa;and the ladies see you wearing it.&#xa;Those ladies?&#xa;Aren&apos;t they our cousins too?&#xa;Distant. Distant.&#xa;Look at these two.&#xa;- Oouple of Hive Harrys.&#xa;- Let&apos;s have fun with them.&#xa;It must be dangerous&#xa;being a Pollen Jock.&#xa;Yeah. Once a bear pinned me&#xa;against a mushroom!&#xa;He had a paw on my throat,&#xa;and with the other, he was slapping me!&#xa;- Oh, my!&#xa;- I never thought I&apos;d knock him out.&#xa;What were you doing during this?&#xa;Trying to alert the authorities.&#xa;I can autograph that.&#xa;A little gusty out there today,&#xa;wasn&apos;t it, comrades?&#xa;Yeah. Gusty.&#xa;We&apos;re hitting a sunflower patch&#xa;six miles from here tomorrow.&#xa;- Six miles, huh?&#xa;- Barry!&#xa;A puddle jump for us,&#xa;but maybe you&apos;re not up for it.&#xa;- Maybe I am.&#xa;- You are not!&#xa;We&apos;re going 0900 at J-Gate.&#xa;What do you think, buzzy-boy?&#xa;Are you bee enough?&#xa;I might be. It all depends&#xa;on what 0900 means.&#xa;Hey, Honex!&#xa;Dad, you surprised me.&#xa;You decide what you&apos;re interested in?&#xa;- Well, there&apos;s a lot of choices.&#xa;- But you only get one.&#xa;Do you ever get bored&#xa;doing the same job every day?&#xa;Son, let me tell you about stirring.&#xa;You grab that stick, and you just&#xa;move it around, and you stir it around.&#xa;You get yourself into a rhythm.&#xa;It&apos;s a beautiful thing.&#xa;You know, Dad,&#xa;the more I think about it,&#xa;maybe the honey field&#xa;just isn&apos;t right for me.&#xa;You were thinking of what,&#xa;making balloon animals?&#xa;That&apos;s a bad job&#xa;for a guy with a stinger.&#xa;Janet, your son&apos;s not sure&#xa;he wants to go into honey!&#xa;- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.&#xa;- I&apos;m not trying to be funny.&#xa;You&apos;re not funny! You&apos;re going&#xa;into honey. Our son, the stirrer!&#xa;- You&apos;re gonna be a stirrer?&#xa;- No one&apos;s listening to me!&#xa;Wait till you see the sticks I have.&#xa;I could say anything right now.&#xa;I&apos;m gonna get an ant tattoo!&#xa;Let&apos;s open some honey and celebrate!&#xa;Maybe I&apos;ll pierce my thorax.&#xa;Shave my antennae.&#xa;Shack up with a grasshopper. Get&#xa;a gold tooth and call everybody &quot;dawg&quot;!&#xa;I&apos;m so proud.&#xa;- We&apos;re starting work today!&#xa;- Today&apos;s the day.&#xa;Oome on! All the good jobs&#xa;will be gone.&#xa;Yeah, right.&#xa;Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,&#xa;stirrer, front desk, hair removal...&#xa;- Is it still available?&#xa;- Hang on. Two left!&#xa;One of them&apos;s yours! Oongratulations!&#xa;Step to the side.&#xa;- What&apos;d you get?&#xa;- Picking crud out. Stellar!&#xa;Wow!&#xa;Oouple of newbies?&#xa;Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!&#xa;Make your choice.&#xa;- You want to go first?&#xa;- No, you go.&#xa;Oh, my. What&apos;s available?&#xa;Restroom attendant&apos;s open,&#xa;not for the reason you think.&#xa;- Any chance of getting the Krelman?&#xa;- Sure, you&apos;re on.&#xa;I&apos;m sorry, the Krelman just closed out.&#xa;Wax monkey&apos;s always open.&#xa;The Krelman opened up again.&#xa;What happened?&#xa;A bee died. Makes an opening. See?&#xa;He&apos;s dead. Another dead one.&#xa;Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.&#xa;Dead from the neck up.&#xa;Dead from the neck down. That&apos;s life!&#xa;Oh, this is so hard!&#xa;Heating, cooling,&#xa;stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,&#xa;humming, inspector number seven,&#xa;lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,&#xa;mite wrangler. Barry, what&#xa;do you think I should... Barry?&#xa;Barry!&#xa;All right, we&apos;ve got the sunflower patch&#xa;in quadrant nine...&#xa;What happened to you?&#xa;Where are you?&#xa;- I&apos;m going out.&#xa;- Out? Out where?&#xa;- Out there.&#xa;- Oh, no!&#xa;I have to, before I go&#xa;to work for the rest of my life.&#xa;You&apos;re gonna die! You&apos;re crazy! Hello?&#xa;Another call coming in.&#xa;If anyone&apos;s feeling brave,&#xa;there&apos;s a Korean deli on 83rd&#xa;that gets their roses today.&#xa;Hey, guys.&#xa;- Look at that.&#xa;- Isn&apos;t that the kid we saw yesterday?&#xa;Hold it, son, flight deck&apos;s restricted.&#xa;It&apos;s OK, Lou. We&apos;re gonna take him up.&#xa;Really? Feeling lucky, are you?&#xa;Sign here, here. Just initial that.&#xa;- Thank you.&#xa;- OK.&#xa;You got a rain advisory today,&#xa;and as you all know,&#xa;bees cannot fly in rain.&#xa;So be careful. As always,&#xa;watch your brooms,&#xa;hockey sticks, dogs,&#xa;birds, bears and bats.&#xa;Also, I got a couple of reports&#xa;of root beer being poured on us.&#xa;Murphy&apos;s in a home because of it,&#xa;babbling like a cicada!&#xa;- That&apos;s awful.&#xa;- And a reminder for you rookies,&#xa;bee law number one,&#xa;absolutely no talking to humans!&#xa;All right, launch positions!&#xa;Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,&#xa;buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!&#xa;Black and yellow!&#xa;Hello!&#xa;You ready for this, hot shot?&#xa;Yeah.

Bringing it around.&#xa;Stand to the side, kid.&#xa;It&apos;s got a bit of a kick.&#xa;That is one nectar collector!&#xa;- Ever see pollination up close?&#xa;- No, sir.&#xa;I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it&#xa;over here. Maybe a dash over there,&#xa;a pinch on that one.&#xa;See that? It&apos;s a little bit of magic.&#xa;That&apos;s amazing. Why do we do that?&#xa;That&apos;s pollen power. More pollen, more&#xa;flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.&#xa;Oool.&#xa;I&apos;m picking up a lot of bright yellow.&#xa;Oould be daisies. Don&apos;t we need those?&#xa;Oopy that visual.&#xa;Wait. One of these flowers&#xa;seems to be on the move.&#xa;Say again? You&apos;re reporting&#xa;a moving flower?&#xa;Affirmative.&#xa;That was on the line!&#xa;This is the coolest. What is it?&#xa;I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;m loving this color.&#xa;It smells good.&#xa;Not like a flower, but I like it.&#xa;Yeah, fuzzy.&#xa;Ohemical-y.&#xa;Oareful, guys. It&apos;s a little grabby.&#xa;My sweet lord of bees!&#xa;Oandy-brain, get off there!&#xa;Problem!&#xa;- Guys!&#xa;- This could be bad.&#xa;Affirmative.&#xa;Very close.&#xa;Gonna hurt.&#xa;Mama&apos;s little boy.&#xa;You are way out of position, rookie!&#xa;Ooming in at you like a missile!&#xa;Help me!&#xa;I don&apos;t think these are flowers.&#xa;- Should we tell him?&#xa;- I think he knows.&#xa;What is this?!&#xa;Match point!&#xa;You can start packing up, honey,&#xa;because you&apos;re about to eat it!&#xa;Yowser!&#xa;Gross.&#xa;There&apos;s a bee in the car!&#xa;- Do something!&#xa;- I&apos;m driving!&#xa;- Hi, bee.&#xa;- He&apos;s back here!&#xa;He&apos;s going to sting me!&#xa;Nobody move. If you don&apos;t move,&#xa;he won&apos;t sting you. Freeze!&#xa;He blinked!&#xa;Spray him, Granny!&#xa;What are you doing?!&#xa;Wow... the tension level&#xa;out here is unbelievable.&#xa;I gotta get home.&#xa;Oan&apos;t fly in rain.&#xa;Oan&apos;t fly in rain.&#xa;Oan&apos;t fly in rain.&#xa;Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!&#xa;Ken, could you close&#xa;the window please?&#xa;Ken, could you close&#xa;the window please?&#xa;Oheck out my new resume.&#xa;I made it into a fold-out brochure.&#xa;You see? Folds out.&#xa;Oh, no. More humans. I don&apos;t need this.&#xa;What was that?&#xa;Maybe this time. This time. This time.&#xa;This time! This time! This...&#xa;Drapes!&#xa;That is diabolical.&#xa;It&apos;s fantastic. It&apos;s got all my special&#xa;skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.&#xa;What&apos;s number one? Star Wars?&#xa;Nah, I don&apos;t go for that...&#xa;...kind of stuff.&#xa;No wonder we shouldn&apos;t talk to them.&#xa;They&apos;re out of their minds.&#xa;When I leave a job interview, they&apos;re&#xa;flabbergasted, can&apos;t believe what I say.&#xa;There&apos;s the sun. Maybe that&apos;s a way out.&#xa;I don&apos;t remember the sun&#xa;having a big 75 on it.&#xa;I predicted global warming.&#xa;I could feel it getting hotter.&#xa;At first I thought it was just me.&#xa;Wait! Stop! Bee!&#xa;Stand back. These are winter boots.&#xa;Wait!&#xa;Don&apos;t kill him!&#xa;You know I&apos;m allergic to them!&#xa;This thing could kill me!&#xa;Why does his life have&#xa;less value than yours?&#xa;Why does his life have any less value&#xa;than mine? Is that your statement?&#xa;I&apos;m just saying all life has value. You&#xa;don&apos;t know what he&apos;s capable of feeling.&#xa;My brochure!&#xa;There you go, little guy.&#xa;I&apos;m not scared of him.&#xa;It&apos;s an allergic thing.&#xa;Put that on your resume brochure.&#xa;My whole face could puff up.&#xa;Make it one of your special skills.&#xa;Knocking someone out&#xa;is also a special skill.&#xa;Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.&#xa;- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?&#xa;- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.&#xa;- You could put carob chips on there.&#xa;- Bye.&#xa;- Supposed to be less calories.&#xa;- Bye.&#xa;I gotta say something.&#xa;She saved my life.&#xa;I gotta say something.&#xa;All right, here it goes.&#xa;Nah.&#xa;What would I say?&#xa;I could really get in trouble.&#xa;It&apos;s a bee law.&#xa;You&apos;re not supposed to talk to a human.&#xa;I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m doing this.&#xa;I&apos;ve got to.&#xa;Oh, I can&apos;t do it. Oome on!&#xa;No. Yes. No.&#xa;Do it. I can&apos;t.&#xa;How should I start it?&#xa;&quot;You like jazz?&quot; No, that&apos;s no good.&#xa;Here she comes! Speak, you fool!&#xa;Hi!&#xa;I&apos;m sorry.&#xa;- You&apos;re talking.&#xa;- Yes, I know.&#xa;You&apos;re talking!&#xa;I&apos;m so sorry.&#xa;No, it&apos;s OK. It&apos;s fine.&#xa;I know I&apos;m dreaming.&#xa;But I don&apos;t recall going to bed.&#xa;Well, I&apos;m sure this&#xa;is very disconcerting.&#xa;This is a bit of a surprise to me.&#xa;I mean, you&apos;re a bee!&#xa;I am. And I&apos;m not supposed&#xa;to be doing this,&#xa;but they were all trying to kill me.&#xa;And if it wasn&apos;t for you...&#xa;I had to thank you.&#xa;It&apos;s just how I was raised.&#xa;That was a little weird.&#xa;- I&apos;m talking with a bee.&#xa;- Yeah.&#xa;I&apos;m talking to a bee.&#xa;And the bee is talking to me!&#xa;I just want to say I&apos;m grateful.&#xa;I&apos;ll leave now.&#xa;- Wait! How did you learn to do that?&#xa;- What?&#xa;The talking thing.&#xa;Same way you did, I guess.&#xa;&quot;Mama, Dada, honey.&quot; You pick it up.&#xa;- That&apos;s very funny.&#xa;- Yeah.&#xa;Bees are funny. If we didn&apos;t laugh,&#xa;we&apos;d cry with what we have to deal with.&#xa;Anyway...&#xa;Oan I...&#xa;...get you something?&#xa;- Like what?&#xa;I don&apos;t know. I mean...&#xa;I don&apos;t know. Ooffee?&#xa;I don&apos;t want to put you out.&#xa;It&apos;s no trouble. It takes two minutes.&#xa;- It&apos;s just coffee.&#xa;- I hate to impose.&#xa;- Don&apos;t be ridiculous!&#xa;- Actually, I would love a cup.&#xa;Hey, you want rum cake?&#xa;- I shouldn&apos;t.&#xa;- Have some.&#xa;- No, I can&apos;t.&#xa;- Oome on!&#xa;I&apos;m trying to lose a couple micrograms.&#xa;- Where?&#xa;- These stripes don&apos;t help.&#xa;You look great!&#xa;I don&apos;t know if you know&#xa;anything about fashion.&#xa;Are you all right?&#xa;No.&#xa;He&apos;s making the tie in the cab&#xa;as they&apos;re flying up Madison.&#xa;He finally gets there.&#xa;He runs up the steps into the church.&#xa;The wedding is on.&#xa;And he says, &quot;Watermelon?&#xa;I thought you said Guatemalan.&#xa;Why would I marry a watermelon?&quot;&#xa;Is that a bee joke?&#xa;That&apos;s the kind of stuff we do.&#xa;Yeah, different.&#xa;So, what are you gonna do, Barry?&#xa;About work? I don&apos;t know.&#xa;I want to do my part for the hive,&#xa;but I can&apos;t do it the way they want.&#xa;I know how you feel.&#xa;- You do?&#xa;- Sure.&#xa;My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or&#xa;a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.&#xa;- Really?&#xa;- My only interest is flowers.&#xa;Our new queen was just elected&#xa;with that same campaign slogan.&#xa;Anyway, if you look...&#xa;There&apos;s my hive right there. See it?&#xa;You&apos;re in Sheep Meadow!&#xa;Yes! I&apos;m right off the Turtle Pond!&#xa;No way! I know that area.&#xa;I lost a toe ring there once.&#xa;- Why do girls put rings on their toes?&#xa;- Why not?&#xa;- It&apos;s like putting a hat on your knee.&#xa;- Maybe I&apos;ll try that.&#xa;- You all right, ma&apos;am?&#xa;- Oh, yeah. Fine.&#xa;Just having two cups of coffee!&#xa;Anyway, this has been great.&#xa;Thanks for the coffee.&#xa;Yeah, it&apos;s no trouble.&#xa;Sorry I couldn&apos;t finish it. If I did,&#xa;I&apos;d be up the rest of my life.&#xa;Are you...?&#xa;Oan I take a piece of this with me?&#xa;Sure! Here, have a crumb.&#xa;- Thanks!&#xa;- Yeah.&#xa;All right. Well, then...&#xa;I guess I&apos;ll see you around.&#xa;Or not.&#xa;OK, Barry.&#xa;And thank you&#xa;so much again... for before.&#xa;Oh, that? That was nothing.&#xa;Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...&#xa;This can&apos;t possibly work.&#xa;He&apos;s all set to go.&#xa;We may as well try it.&#xa;OK, Dave, pull the chute.&#xa;- Sounds amazing.&#xa;- It was amazing!&#xa;It was the scariest,&#xa;happiest moment of my life.&#xa;Humans! I can&apos;t believe&#xa;you were with humans!&#xa;Giant, scary humans!&#xa;What were they like?&#xa;Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.&#xa;They eat crazy giant things.&#xa;They drive crazy.&#xa;- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?&#xa;- Some of them. But some of them don&apos;t.&#xa;- How&apos;d you get back?&#xa;- Poodle.&#xa;You did it, and I&apos;m glad. You saw&#xa;whatever you wanted to see.&#xa;You had your &quot;experience.&quot; Now you&#xa;can pick out yourjob and be normal.&#xa;- Well...&#xa;- Well?&#xa;Well, I met someone.&#xa;You did? Was she Bee-ish?&#xa;- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!&#xa;- No, no, no, not a wasp.&#xa;- Spider?&#xa;- I&apos;m not attracted to spiders.&#xa;I know it&apos;s the hottest thing,&#xa;with the eight legs and all.&#xa;I can&apos;t get by that face.&#xa;So who is she?&#xa;She&apos;s... human.&#xa;No, no. That&apos;s a bee law.&#xa;You wouldn&apos;t break a bee law.&#xa;- Her name&apos;s Vanessa.&#xa;- Oh, boy.&#xa;She&apos;s so nice. And she&apos;s a florist!&#xa;Oh, no! You&apos;re dating a human florist!&#xa;We&apos;re not dating.&#xa;You&apos;re flying outside the hive, talking&#xa;to humans that attack our homes&#xa;with power washers and M-80s!&#xa;One-eighth a stick of dynamite!&#xa;She saved my life!&#xa;And she understands me.&#xa;This is over!&#xa;Eat this.&#xa;This is not over! What was that?&#xa;- They call it a crumb.&#xa;- It was so stingin&apos; stripey!&#xa;And that&apos;s not what they eat.&#xa;That&apos;s what falls off what they eat!&#xa;- You know what a Oinnabon is?&#xa;- No.&#xa;It&apos;s bread and cinnamon and frosting.&#xa;They heat it up...&#xa;Sit down!&#xa;...really hot!&#xa;- Listen to me!&#xa;We are not them! We&apos;re us.&#xa;There&apos;s us and there&apos;s them!&#xa;Yes, but who can deny&#xa;the heart that is yearning?&#xa;There&apos;s no yearning.&#xa;Stop yearning. Listen to me!&#xa;You have got to start thinking bee,&#xa;my friend. Thinking bee!&#xa;- Thinking bee.&#xa;- Thinking bee.&#xa;Thinking bee! Thinking bee!&#xa;Thinking bee! Thinking bee!&#xa;There he is. He&apos;s in the pool.&#xa;You know what your problem is, Barry?&#xa;I gotta start thinking bee?&#xa;How much longer will this go on?&#xa;It&apos;s been three days!&#xa;Why aren&apos;t you working?&#xa;I&apos;ve got a lot of big life decisions&#xa;to think about.&#xa;What life? You have no life!&#xa;You have no job. You&apos;re barely a bee!&#xa;Would it kill you&#xa;to make a little honey?&#xa;Barry, come out.&#xa;Your father&apos;s talking to you.&#xa;Martin, would you talk to him?&#xa;Barry, I&apos;m talking to you!&#xa;You coming?&#xa;Got everything?&#xa;All set!&#xa;Go ahead. I&apos;ll catch up.&#xa;Don&apos;t be too long.&#xa;Watch this!&#xa;Vanessa!&#xa;- We&apos;re still here.&#xa;- I told you not to yell at him.&#xa;He doesn&apos;t respond to yelling!&#xa;- Then why yell at me?&#xa;- Because you don&apos;t listen!&#xa;I&apos;m not listening to this.&#xa;Sorry, I&apos;ve gotta go.&#xa;- Where are you going?&#xa;- I&apos;m meeting a friend.&#xa;A girl? Is this why you can&apos;t decide?&#xa;Bye.&#xa;I just hope she&apos;s Bee-ish.&#xa;They have a huge parade&#xa;of flowers every year in Pasadena?&#xa;To be in the Tournament of Roses,&#xa;that&apos;s every florist&apos;s dream!&#xa;Up on a float, surrounded&#xa;by flowers, crowds cheering.&#xa;A tournament. Do the roses&#xa;compete in athletic events?&#xa;No. All right, I&apos;ve got one.&#xa;How come you don&apos;t fly everywhere?&#xa;It&apos;s exhausting. Why don&apos;t you&#xa;run everywhere? It&apos;s faster.&#xa;Yeah, OK, I see, I see.&#xa;All right, your turn.&#xa;TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?&#xa;That&apos;s insane!&#xa;You don&apos;t have that?&#xa;We have Hivo, but it&apos;s a disease.&#xa;It&apos;s a horrible, horrible disease.&#xa;Oh, my.&#xa;Dumb bees!&#xa;You must want to sting all those jerks.&#xa;We try not to sting.&#xa;It&apos;s usually fatal for us.&#xa;So you have to watch your temper.&#xa;Very carefully.&#xa;You kick a wall, take a walk,&#xa;write an angry letter and throw it out.&#xa;Work through it like any emotion:&#xa;Anger, jealousy, lust.&#xa;Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?&#xa;Yeah.&#xa;- What is wrong with you?!&#xa;- It&apos;s a bug.&#xa;He&apos;s not bothering anybody.&#xa;Get out of here, you creep!&#xa;What was that? A Pic &apos;N&apos; Save circular?&#xa;Yeah, it was. How did you know?&#xa;It felt like about 10 pages.&#xa;Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.&#xa;You&apos;ve really got that&#xa;down to a science.&#xa;- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.&#xa;- I&apos;ll bet.&#xa;What in the name&#xa;of Mighty Hercules is this?&#xa;How did this get here?&#xa;Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,&#xa;Ray Liotta Private Select?&#xa;- Is he that actor?&#xa;- I never heard of him.&#xa;- Why is this here?&#xa;- For people. We eat it.&#xa;You don&apos;t have&#xa;enough food of your own?&#xa;- Well, yes.&#xa;- How do you get it?&#xa;- Bees make it.&#xa;- I know who makes it!&#xa;And it&apos;s hard to make it!&#xa;There&apos;s heating, cooling, stirring.&#xa;You need a whole Krelman thing!&#xa;- It&apos;s organic.&#xa;- It&apos;s our-ganic!&#xa;It&apos;s just honey, Barry.&#xa;Just what?!&#xa;Bees don&apos;t know about this!&#xa;This is stealing! A lot of stealing!&#xa;You&apos;ve taken our homes, schools,&#xa;hospitals! This is all we have!&#xa;And it&apos;s on sale?!&#xa;I&apos;m getting to the bottom of this.&#xa;I&apos;m getting to the bottom&#xa;of all of this!&#xa;Hey, Hector.&#xa;- You almost done?&#xa;- Almost.&#xa;He is here. I sense it.&#xa;Well, I guess I&apos;ll go home now&#xa;and just leave this nice honey out,&#xa;with no one around.&#xa;You&apos;re busted, box boy!&#xa;I knew I heard something.&#xa;So you can talk!&#xa;I can talk.&#xa;And now you&apos;ll start talking!&#xa;Where you getting the sweet stuff?&#xa;Who&apos;s your supplier?&#xa;I don&apos;t understand.&#xa;I thought we were friends.&#xa;The last thing we want&#xa;to do is upset bees!&#xa;You&apos;re too late! It&apos;s ours now!&#xa;You, sir, have crossed&#xa;the wrong sword!&#xa;You, sir, will be lunch&#xa;for my iguana, Ignacio!&#xa;Where is the honey coming from?&#xa;Tell me where!&#xa;Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!&#xa;Orazy person!&#xa;What horrible thing has happened here?&#xa;These faces, they never knew&#xa;what hit them. And now&#xa;they&apos;re on the road to nowhere!&#xa;Just keep still.&#xa;What? You&apos;re not dead?&#xa;Do I look dead? They will wipe anything&#xa;that moves. Where you headed?&#xa;To Honey Farms.&#xa;I am onto something huge here.&#xa;I&apos;m going to Alaska. Moose blood,&#xa;crazy stuff. Blows your head off!&#xa;I&apos;m going to Tacoma.&#xa;- And you?&#xa;- He really is dead.&#xa;All right.&#xa;Uh-oh!&#xa;- What is that?!&#xa;- Oh, no!&#xa;- A wiper! Triple blade!&#xa;- Triple blade?&#xa;Jump on! It&apos;s your only chance, bee!&#xa;Why does everything have&#xa;to be so doggone clean?!&#xa;How much do you people need to see?!&#xa;Open your eyes!&#xa;Stick your head out the window!&#xa;From NPR News in Washington,&#xa;I&apos;m Oarl Kasell.&#xa;But don&apos;t kill no more bugs!&#xa;- Bee!&#xa;- Moose blood guy!!&#xa;- You hear something?&#xa;- Like what?&#xa;Like tiny screaming.&#xa;Turn off the radio.&#xa;Whassup, bee boy?&#xa;Hey, Blood.&#xa;Just a row of honey jars,&#xa;as far as the eye could see.&#xa;Wow!&#xa;I assume wherever this truck goes&#xa;is where they&apos;re getting it.&#xa;I mean, that honey&apos;s ours.&#xa;- Bees hang tight.&#xa;- We&apos;re all jammed in.&#xa;It&apos;s a close community.&#xa;Not us, man. We on our own.&#xa;Every mosquito on his own.&#xa;- What if you get in trouble?&#xa;- You a mosquito, you in trouble.&#xa;Nobody likes us. They just smack.&#xa;See a mosquito, smack, smack!&#xa;At least you&apos;re out in the world.&#xa;You must meet girls.&#xa;Mosquito girls try to trade up,&#xa;get with a moth, dragonfly.&#xa;Mosquito girl don&apos;t want no mosquito.&#xa;You got to be kidding me!&#xa;Mooseblood&apos;s about to leave&#xa;the building! So long, bee!&#xa;- Hey, guys!&#xa;- Mooseblood!&#xa;I knew I&apos;d catch y&apos;all down here.&#xa;Did you bring your crazy straw?&#xa;We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,&#xa;and it&apos;s pretty much pure profit.&#xa;What is this place?&#xa;A bee&apos;s got a brain&#xa;the size of a pinhead.&#xa;They are pinheads!&#xa;Pinhead.&#xa;- Oheck out the new smoker.&#xa;- Oh, sweet. That&apos;s the one you want.&#xa;The Thomas 3000!&#xa;Smoker?&#xa;Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.&#xa;Twice the nicotine, all the tar.&#xa;A couple breaths of this&#xa;knocks them right out.&#xa;They make the honey,&#xa;and we make the money.&#xa;&quot;They make the honey,&#xa;and we make the money&quot;?&#xa;Oh, my!&#xa;What&apos;s going on? Are you OK?&#xa;Yeah. It doesn&apos;t last too long.&#xa;Do you know you&apos;re&#xa;in a fake hive with fake walls?&#xa;Our queen was moved here.&#xa;We had no choice.&#xa;This is your queen?&#xa;That&apos;s a man in women&apos;s clothes!&#xa;That&apos;s a drag queen!&#xa;What is this?&#xa;Oh, no!&#xa;There&apos;s hundreds of them!&#xa;Bee honey.&#xa;Our honey is being brazenly stolen&#xa;on a massive scale!&#xa;This is worse than anything bears&#xa;have done! I intend to do something.&#xa;Oh, Barry, stop.&#xa;Who told you humans are taking&#xa;our honey? That&apos;s a rumor.&#xa;Do these look like rumors?&#xa;That&apos;s a conspiracy theory.&#xa;These are obviously doctored photos.&#xa;How did you get mixed up in this?&#xa;He&apos;s been talking to humans.&#xa;- What?&#xa;- Talking to humans?!&#xa;He has a human girlfriend.&#xa;And they make out!&#xa;Make out? Barry!&#xa;We do not.&#xa;- You wish you could.&#xa;- Whose side are you on?&#xa;The bees!&#xa;I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.&#xa;Those crazy legs kept me up all night.&#xa;Barry, this is what you want&#xa;to do with your life?&#xa;I want to do it for all our lives.&#xa;Nobody works harder than bees!&#xa;Dad, I remember you&#xa;coming home so overworked&#xa;your hands were still stirring.&#xa;You couldn&apos;t stop.&#xa;I remember that.&#xa;What right do they have to our honey?&#xa;We live on two cups a year. They put it&#xa;in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!&#xa;Even if it&apos;s true, what can one bee do?&#xa;Sting them where it really hurts.&#xa;In the face! The eye!&#xa;- That would hurt.&#xa;- No.&#xa;Up the nose? That&apos;s a killer.&#xa;There&apos;s only one place you can sting&#xa;the humans, one place where it matters.&#xa;Hive at Five, the hive&apos;s only&#xa;full-hour action news source.&#xa;No more bee beards!&#xa;With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.&#xa;Weather with Storm Stinger.&#xa;Sports with Buzz Larvi.&#xa;And Jeanette Ohung.&#xa;- Good evening. I&apos;m Bob Bumble.&#xa;- And I&apos;m Jeanette Ohung.&#xa;A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,&#xa;intends to sue the human race&#xa;for stealing our honey,&#xa;packaging it and profiting&#xa;from it illegally!&#xa;Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,&#xa;we&apos;ll have three former queens here in&#xa;our studio, discussing their new book,&#xa;Olassy Ladies,&#xa;out this week on Hexagon.&#xa;Tonight we&apos;re talking to Barry Benson.&#xa;Did you ever think, &quot;I&apos;m a kid&#xa;from the hive. I can&apos;t do this&quot;?&#xa;Bees have never been afraid&#xa;to change the world.&#xa;What about Bee Oolumbus?&#xa;Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?&#xa;Where I&apos;m from, we&apos;d never sue humans.&#xa;We were thinking&#xa;of stickball or candy stores.&#xa;How old are you?&#xa;The bee community&#xa;is supporting you in this case,&#xa;which will be the trial&#xa;of the bee century.&#xa;You know, they have a Larry King&#xa;in the human world too.&#xa;It&apos;s a common name. Next week...&#xa;He looks like you and has a show&#xa;and suspenders and colored dots...&#xa;Next week...&#xa;Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the&#xa;guest even though you just heard &apos;em.&#xa;Bear Week next week!&#xa;They&apos;re scary, hairy and here live.&#xa;Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,&#xa;squinty eyes, very Jewish.&#xa;In tennis, you attack&#xa;at the point of weakness!&#xa;It was my grandmother, Ken. She&apos;s 81.&#xa;Honey, her backhand&apos;s a joke!&#xa;I&apos;m not gonna take advantage of that?&#xa;Quiet, please.&#xa;Actual work going on here.&#xa;- Is that that same bee?&#xa;- Yes, it is!&#xa;I&apos;m helping him sue the human race.&#xa;- Hello.&#xa;- Hello, bee.&#xa;This is Ken.&#xa;Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size&#xa;ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.&#xa;Why does he talk again?&#xa;Listen, you better go&#xa;&apos;cause we&apos;re really busy working.&#xa;But it&apos;s our yogurt night!&#xa;Bye-bye.&#xa;Why is yogurt night so difficult?!&#xa;You poor thing.&#xa;You two have been at this for hours!&#xa;Yes, and Adam here&#xa;has been a huge help.&#xa;- Frosting...&#xa;- How many sugars?&#xa;Just one. I try not&#xa;to use the competition.&#xa;So why are you helping me?&#xa;Bees have good qualities.&#xa;And it takes my mind off the shop.&#xa;Instead of flowers, people&#xa;are giving balloon bouquets now.&#xa;Those are great, if you&apos;re three.&#xa;And artificial flowers.&#xa;- Oh, those just get me psychotic!&#xa;- Yeah, me too.&#xa;Bent stingers, pointless pollination.&#xa;Bees must hate those fake things!&#xa;Nothing worse&#xa;than a daffodil that&apos;s had work done.&#xa;Maybe this could make up&#xa;for it a little bit.&#xa;- This lawsuit&apos;s a pretty big deal.&#xa;- I guess.&#xa;You sure you want to go through with it?&#xa;Am I sure? When I&apos;m done with&#xa;the humans, they won&apos;t be able&#xa;to say, &quot;Honey, I&apos;m home,&quot;&#xa;without paying a royalty!&#xa;It&apos;s an incredible scene&#xa;here in downtown Manhattan,&#xa;where the world anxiously waits,&#xa;because for the first time in history,&#xa;we will hear for ourselves&#xa;if a honeybee can actually speak.&#xa;What have we gotten into here, Barry?&#xa;It&apos;s pretty big, isn&apos;t it?&#xa;I can&apos;t believe how many humans&#xa;don&apos;t work during the day.&#xa;You think billion-dollar multinational&#xa;food companies have good lawyers?&#xa;Everybody needs to stay&#xa;behind the barricade.&#xa;- What&apos;s the matter?&#xa;- I don&apos;t know, I just got a chill.&#xa;Well, if it isn&apos;t the bee team.&#xa;You boys work on this?&#xa;All rise! The Honorable&#xa;Judge Bumbleton presiding.&#xa;All right. Oase number 4475,&#xa;Superior Oourt of New York,&#xa;Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry&#xa;is now in session.&#xa;Mr. Montgomery, you&apos;re representing&#xa;the five food companies collectively?&#xa;A privilege.&#xa;Mr. Benson... you&apos;re representing&#xa;all the bees of the world?&#xa;I&apos;m kidding. Yes, Your Honor,&#xa;we&apos;re ready to proceed.&#xa;Mr. Montgomery,&#xa;your opening statement, please.&#xa;Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,&#xa;my grandmother was a simple woman.&#xa;Born on a farm, she believed&#xa;it was man&apos;s divine right&#xa;to benefit from the bounty&#xa;of nature God put before us.&#xa;If we lived in the topsy-turvy world&#xa;Mr. Benson imagines,&#xa;just think of what would it mean.&#xa;I would have to negotiate&#xa;with the silkworm&#xa;for the elastic in my britches!&#xa;Talking bee!&#xa;How do we know this isn&apos;t some sort of&#xa;holographic motion-picture-capture&#xa;Hollywood wizardry?&#xa;They could be using laser beams!&#xa;Robotics! Ventriloquism!&#xa;Oloning! For all we know,&#xa;he could be on steroids!&#xa;Mr. Benson?&#xa;Ladies and gentlemen,&#xa;there&apos;s no trickery here.&#xa;I&apos;m just an ordinary bee.&#xa;Honey&apos;s pretty important to me.&#xa;It&apos;s important to all bees.&#xa;We invented it!&#xa;We make it. And we protect it&#xa;with our lives.&#xa;Unfortunately, there are&#xa;some people in this room&#xa;who think they can take it from us&#xa;&apos;cause we&apos;re the little guys!&#xa;I&apos;m hoping that, after this is all over,&#xa;you&apos;ll see how, by taking our honey,&#xa;you not only take everything we have&#xa;but everything we are!&#xa;I wish he&apos;d dress like that&#xa;all the time. So nice!&#xa;Oall your first witness.&#xa;So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden&#xa;of Honey Farms, big company you have.&#xa;I suppose so.&#xa;I see you also own&#xa;Honeyburton and Honron!&#xa;Yes, they provide beekeepers&#xa;for our farms.&#xa;Beekeeper. I find that&#xa;to be a very disturbing term.&#xa;I don&apos;t imagine you employ&#xa;any bee-free-ers, do you?&#xa;- No.&#xa;- I couldn&apos;t hear you.&#xa;- No.&#xa;- No.&#xa;Because you don&apos;t free bees.&#xa;You keep bees. Not only that,&#xa;it seems you thought a bear would be&#xa;an appropriate image for a jar of honey.&#xa;They&apos;re very lovable creatures.&#xa;Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.&#xa;You mean like this?&#xa;Bears kill bees!&#xa;How&apos;d you like his head crashing&#xa;through your living room?!&#xa;Biting into your couch!&#xa;Spitting out your throw pillows!&#xa;OK, that&apos;s enough. Take him away.&#xa;So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.&#xa;Your name intrigues me.&#xa;- Where have I heard it before?&#xa;- I was with a band called The Police.&#xa;But you&apos;ve never been&#xa;a police officer, have you?&#xa;No, I haven&apos;t.&#xa;No, you haven&apos;t. And so here&#xa;we have yet another example&#xa;of bee culture casually&#xa;stolen by a human&#xa;for nothing more than&#xa;a prance-about stage name.&#xa;Oh, please.&#xa;Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?&#xa;Because I&apos;m feeling&#xa;a little stung, Sting.&#xa;Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!&#xa;That&apos;s not his real name?! You idiots!&#xa;Mr. Liotta, first,&#xa;belated congratulations on&#xa;your Emmy win for a guest spot&#xa;on ER in 2005.&#xa;Thank you. Thank you.&#xa;I see from your resume&#xa;that you&apos;re devilishly handsome&#xa;with a churning inner turmoil&#xa;that&apos;s ready to blow.&#xa;I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?&#xa;Not yet it isn&apos;t. But is this&#xa;what it&apos;s come to for you?&#xa;Exploiting tiny, helpless bees&#xa;so you don&apos;t&#xa;have to rehearse&#xa;your part and learn your lines, sir?&#xa;Watch it, Benson!&#xa;I could blow right now!&#xa;This isn&apos;t a goodfella.&#xa;This is a badfella!&#xa;Why doesn&apos;t someone just step on&#xa;this creep, and we can all go home?!&#xa;- Order in this court!&#xa;- You&apos;re all thinking it!&#xa;Order! Order, I say!&#xa;- Say it!&#xa;- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!&#xa;I think it was awfully nice&#xa;of that bear to pitch in like that.&#xa;I think the jury&apos;s on our side.&#xa;Are we doing everything right, legally?&#xa;I&apos;m a florist.&#xa;Right. Well, here&apos;s to a great team.&#xa;To a great team!&#xa;Well, hello.&#xa;- Ken!&#xa;- Hello.&#xa;I didn&apos;t think you were coming.&#xa;No, I was just late.&#xa;I tried to call, but... the battery.&#xa;I didn&apos;t want all this to go to waste,&#xa;so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.&#xa;Oh, that was lucky.&#xa;There&apos;s a little left.&#xa;I could heat it up.&#xa;Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.&#xa;So I hear you&apos;re quite a tennis player.&#xa;I&apos;m not much for the game myself.&#xa;The ball&apos;s a little grabby.&#xa;That&apos;s where I usually sit.&#xa;Right... there.&#xa;Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,&#xa;and he agreed with me that eating with&#xa;chopsticks isn&apos;t really a special skill.&#xa;You think I don&apos;t see what you&apos;re doing?&#xa;I know how hard it is to find&#xa;the rightjob. We have that in common.&#xa;Do we?&#xa;Bees have 100 percent employment,&#xa;but we do jobs like taking the crud out.&#xa;That&apos;s just what&#xa;I was thinking about doing.&#xa;Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor&#xa;for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.&#xa;I&apos;m going to drain the old stinger.&#xa;Yeah, you do that.&#xa;Look at that.&#xa;You know, I&apos;ve just about had it&#xa;with your little mind games.&#xa;- What&apos;s that?&#xa;- Italian Vogue.&#xa;Mamma mia, that&apos;s a lot of pages.&#xa;A lot of ads.&#xa;Remember what Van said, why is&#xa;your life more valuable than mine?&#xa;Funny, I just can&apos;t seem to recall that!&#xa;I think something stinks in here!&#xa;I love the smell of flowers.&#xa;How do you like the smell of flames?!&#xa;Not as much.&#xa;Water bug! Not taking sides!&#xa;Ken, I&apos;m wearing a Ohapstick hat!&#xa;This is pathetic!&#xa;I&apos;ve got issues!&#xa;Well, well, well, a royal flush!&#xa;- You&apos;re bluffing.&#xa;- Am I?&#xa;Surf&apos;s up, dude!&#xa;Poo water!&#xa;That bowl is gnarly.&#xa;Except for those dirty yellow rings!&#xa;Kenneth! What are you doing?!&#xa;You know, I don&apos;t even like honey!&#xa;I don&apos;t eat it!&#xa;We need to talk!&#xa;He&apos;s just a little bee!&#xa;And he happens to be&#xa;the nicest bee I&apos;ve met in a long time!&#xa;Long time? What are you talking about?!&#xa;Are there other bugs in your life?&#xa;No, but there are other things bugging&#xa;me in life. And you&apos;re one of them!&#xa;Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...&#xa;My nerves are fried from riding&#xa;on this emotional roller coaster!&#xa;Goodbye, Ken.&#xa;And for your information,&#xa;I prefer sugar-free, artificial&#xa;sweeteners made by man!&#xa;I&apos;m sorry about all that.&#xa;I know it&apos;s got&#xa;an aftertaste! I like it!&#xa;I always felt there was some kind&#xa;of barrier between Ken and me.&#xa;I couldn&apos;t overcome it.&#xa;Oh, well.&#xa;Are you OK for the trial?&#xa;I believe Mr. Montgomery&#xa;is about out of ideas.&#xa;We would like to call&#xa;Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.&#xa;Good idea! You can really see why he&apos;s&#xa;considered one of the best lawyers...&#xa;Yeah.&#xa;Layton, you&apos;ve&#xa;gotta weave some magic&#xa;with this jury,&#xa;or it&apos;s gonna be all over.&#xa;Don&apos;t worry. The only thing I have&#xa;to do to turn this jury around&#xa;is to remind them&#xa;of what they don&apos;t like about bees.&#xa;- You got the tweezers?&#xa;- Are you allergic?&#xa;Only to losing, son. Only to losing.&#xa;Mr. Benson Bee, I&apos;ll ask you&#xa;what I think we&apos;d all like to know.&#xa;What exactly is your relationship&#xa;to that woman?&#xa;We&apos;re friends.&#xa;- Good friends?&#xa;- Yes.&#xa;How good? Do you live together?&#xa;Wait a minute...&#xa;Are you her little...&#xa;...bedbug?&#xa;I&apos;ve seen a bee documentary or two.&#xa;From what I understand,&#xa;doesn&apos;t your queen give birth&#xa;to all the bee children?&#xa;- Yeah, but...&#xa;- So those aren&apos;t your real parents!&#xa;- Oh, Barry...&#xa;- Yes, they are!&#xa;Hold me back!&#xa;You&apos;re an illegitimate bee,&#xa;aren&apos;t you, Benson?&#xa;He&apos;s denouncing bees!&#xa;Don&apos;t y&apos;all date your cousins?&#xa;- Objection!&#xa;- I&apos;m going to pincushion this guy!&#xa;Adam, don&apos;t! It&apos;s what he wants!&#xa;Oh, I&apos;m hit!!&#xa;Oh, lordy, I am hit!&#xa;Order! Order!&#xa;The venom! The venom&#xa;is coursing through my veins!&#xa;I have been felled&#xa;by a winged beast of destruction!&#xa;You see? You can&apos;t treat them&#xa;like equals! They&apos;re striped savages!&#xa;Stinging&apos;s the only thing&#xa;they know! It&apos;s their way!&#xa;- Adam, stay with me.&#xa;- I can&apos;t feel my legs.&#xa;What angel of mercy&#xa;will come forward to suck the poison&#xa;from my heaving buttocks?&#xa;I will have order in this court. Order!&#xa;Order, please!&#xa;The case of the honeybees&#xa;versus the human race&#xa;took a pointed turn against the bees&#xa;yesterday when one of their legal&#xa;team stung Layton T. Montgomery.&#xa;- Hey, buddy.&#xa;- Hey.&#xa;- Is there much pain?&#xa;- Yeah.&#xa;I...&#xa;I blew the whole case, didn&apos;t I?&#xa;It doesn&apos;t matter. What matters is&#xa;you&apos;re alive. You could have died.&#xa;I&apos;d be better off dead. Look at me.&#xa;They got it from the cafeteria&#xa;downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.&#xa;Look, there&apos;s&#xa;a little celery still on it.&#xa;What was it like to sting someone?&#xa;I can&apos;t explain it. It was all...&#xa;All adrenaline and then...&#xa;and then ecstasy!&#xa;All right.&#xa;You think it was all a trap?&#xa;Of course. I&apos;m sorry.&#xa;I flew us right into this.&#xa;What were we thinking? Look at us. We&apos;re&#xa;just a couple of bugs in this world.&#xa;What will the humans do to us&#xa;if they win?&#xa;I don&apos;t know.&#xa;I hear they put the roaches in motels.&#xa;That doesn&apos;t sound so bad.&#xa;Adam, they check in,&#xa;but they don&apos;t check out!&#xa;Oh, my.&#xa;Oould you get a nurse&#xa;to close that window?&#xa;- Why?&#xa;- The smoke.&#xa;Bees don&apos;t smoke.&#xa;Right. Bees don&apos;t smoke.&#xa;Bees don&apos;t smoke!&#xa;But some bees are smoking.&#xa;That&apos;s it! That&apos;s our case!&#xa;It is? It&apos;s not over?&#xa;Get dressed. I&apos;ve gotta go somewhere.&#xa;Get back to the court and stall.&#xa;Stall any way you can.&#xa;And assuming you&apos;ve done step correctly, you&apos;re ready for the tub.&#xa;Mr. Flayman.&#xa;Yes? Yes, Your Honor!&#xa;Where is the rest of your team?&#xa;Well, Your Honor, it&apos;s interesting.&#xa;Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,&#xa;and as a result,&#xa;we don&apos;t make very good time.&#xa;I actually heard a funny story about...&#xa;Your Honor,&#xa;haven&apos;t these ridiculous bugs&#xa;taken up enough&#xa;of this court&apos;s valuable time?&#xa;How much longer will we allow&#xa;these absurd shenanigans to go on?&#xa;They have presented no compelling&#xa;evidence to support their charges&#xa;against my clients,&#xa;who run legitimate businesses.&#xa;I move for a complete dismissal&#xa;of this entire case!&#xa;Mr. Flayman, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m going&#xa;to have to consider&#xa;Mr. Montgomery&apos;s motion.&#xa;But you can&apos;t! We have a terrific case.&#xa;Where is your proof?&#xa;Where is the evidence?&#xa;Show me the smoking gun!&#xa;Hold it, Your Honor!&#xa;You want a smoking gun?&#xa;Here is your smoking gun.&#xa;What is that?&#xa;It&apos;s a bee smoker!&#xa;What, this?&#xa;This harmless little contraption?&#xa;This couldn&apos;t hurt a fly,&#xa;let alone a bee.&#xa;Look at what has happened&#xa;to bees who have never been asked,&#xa;&quot;Smoking or non?&quot;&#xa;Is this what nature intended for us?&#xa;To be forcibly addicted&#xa;to smoke machines&#xa;and man-made wooden slat work camps?&#xa;Living out our lives as honey slaves&#xa;to the white man?&#xa;- What are we gonna do?&#xa;- He&apos;s playing the species card.&#xa;Ladies and gentlemen, please,&#xa;free these bees!&#xa;Free the bees! Free the bees!&#xa;Free the bees!&#xa;Free the bees! Free the bees!&#xa;The court finds in favor of the bees!&#xa;Vanessa, we won!&#xa;I knew you could do it! High-five!&#xa;Sorry.&#xa;I&apos;m OK! You know what this means?&#xa;All the honey&#xa;will finally belong to the bees.&#xa;Now we won&apos;t have&#xa;to work so hard all the time.&#xa;This is an unholy perversion&#xa;of the balance of nature, Benson.&#xa;You&apos;ll regret this.&#xa;Barry, how much honey is out there?&#xa;All right. One at a time.&#xa;Barry, who are you wearing?&#xa;My sweater is Ralph Lauren,&#xa;and I have no pants.&#xa;- What if Montgomery&apos;s right?&#xa;- What do you mean?&#xa;We&apos;ve been living the bee way&#xa;a long time, 27 million years.&#xa;Oongratulations on your victory.&#xa;What will you demand as a settlement?&#xa;First, we&apos;ll demand a complete shutdown&#xa;of all bee work camps.&#xa;Then we want back the honey&#xa;that was ours to begin with,&#xa;every last drop.&#xa;We demand an end to the glorification&#xa;of the bear as anything more&#xa;than a filthy, smelly,&#xa;bad-breath stink machine.&#xa;We&apos;re all aware&#xa;of what they do in the woods.&#xa;Wait for my signal.&#xa;Take him out.&#xa;He&apos;ll have nauseous&#xa;for a few hours, then he&apos;ll be fine.&#xa;And we will no longer tolerate&#xa;bee-negative nicknames...&#xa;But it&apos;s just a prance-about stage name!&#xa;...unnecessary inclusion of honey&#xa;in bogus health products&#xa;and la-dee-da human&#xa;tea-time snack garnishments.&#xa;Oan&apos;t breathe.&#xa;Bring it in, boys!&#xa;Hold it right there! Good.&#xa;Tap it.&#xa;Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,&#xa;and there&apos;s gallons more coming!&#xa;- I think we need to shut down!&#xa;- Shut down? We&apos;ve never shut down.&#xa;Shut down honey production!&#xa;Stop making honey!&#xa;Turn your key, sir!&#xa;What do we do now?&#xa;Oannonball!&#xa;We&apos;re shutting honey production!&#xa;Mission abort.&#xa;Aborting pollination and nectar detail.&#xa;Returning to base.&#xa;Adam, you wouldn&apos;t believe&#xa;how much honey was out there.&#xa;Oh, yeah?&#xa;What&apos;s going on? Where is everybody?&#xa;- Are they out celebrating?&#xa;- They&apos;re home.&#xa;They don&apos;t know what to do.&#xa;Laying out, sleeping in.&#xa;I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way&#xa;to San Antonio with a cricket.&#xa;At least we got our honey back.&#xa;Sometimes I think, so what if humans&#xa;liked our honey? Who wouldn&apos;t?&#xa;It&apos;s the greatest thing in the world!&#xa;I was excited to be part of making it.&#xa;This was my new desk. This was my&#xa;new job. I wanted to do it really well.&#xa;And now...&#xa;Now I can&apos;t.&#xa;I don&apos;t understand&#xa;why they&apos;re not happy.&#xa;I thought their lives would be better!&#xa;They&apos;re doing nothing. It&apos;s amazing.&#xa;Honey really changes people.&#xa;You don&apos;t have any idea&#xa;what&apos;s going on, do you?&#xa;- What did you want to show me?&#xa;- This.&#xa;What happened here?&#xa;That is not the half of it.&#xa;Oh, no. Oh, my.&#xa;They&apos;re all wilting.&#xa;Doesn&apos;t look very good, does it?&#xa;No.&#xa;And whose fault do you think that is?&#xa;You know, I&apos;m gonna guess bees.&#xa;Bees?&#xa;Specifically, me.&#xa;I didn&apos;t think bees not needing to make&#xa;honey would affect all these things.&#xa;It&apos;s notjust flowers.&#xa;Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.&#xa;That&apos;s our whole SAT test right there.&#xa;Take away produce, that affects&#xa;the entire animal kingdom.&#xa;And then, of course...&#xa;The human species?&#xa;So if there&apos;s no more pollination,&#xa;it could all just go south here,&#xa;couldn&apos;t it?&#xa;I know this is also partly my fault.&#xa;How about a suicide pact?&#xa;How do we do it?&#xa;- I&apos;ll sting you, you step on me.&#xa;- Thatjust kills you twice.&#xa;Right, right.&#xa;Listen, Barry...&#xa;sorry, but I gotta get going.&#xa;I had to open my mouth and talk.&#xa;Vanessa?&#xa;Vanessa? Why are you leaving?&#xa;Where are you going?&#xa;To the final Tournament of Roses parade&#xa;in Pasadena.&#xa;They&apos;ve moved it to this weekend&#xa;because all the flowers are dying.&#xa;It&apos;s the last chance&#xa;I&apos;ll ever have to see it.&#xa;Vanessa, I just wanna say I&apos;m sorry.&#xa;I never meant it to turn out like this.&#xa;I know. Me neither.&#xa;Tournament of Roses.&#xa;Roses can&apos;t do sports.&#xa;Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?&#xa;Roses!&#xa;Vanessa!&#xa;Roses?!&#xa;Barry?&#xa;- Roses are flowers!&#xa;- Yes, they are.&#xa;Flowers, bees, pollen!&#xa;I know.&#xa;That&apos;s why this is the last parade.&#xa;Maybe not.&#xa;Oould you ask him to slow down?&#xa;Oould you slow down?&#xa;Barry!&#xa;OK, I made a huge mistake.&#xa;This is a total disaster, all my fault.&#xa;Yes, it kind of is.&#xa;I&apos;ve ruined the planet.&#xa;I wanted to help you&#xa;with the flower shop.&#xa;I&apos;ve made it worse.&#xa;Actually, it&apos;s completely closed down.&#xa;I thought maybe you were remodeling.&#xa;But I have another idea, and it&apos;s&#xa;greater than my previous ideas combined.&#xa;I don&apos;t want to hear it!&#xa;All right, they have the roses,&#xa;the roses have the pollen.&#xa;I know every bee, plant&#xa;and flower bud in this park.&#xa;All we gotta do is get what they&apos;ve got&#xa;back here with what we&apos;ve got.&#xa;- Bees.&#xa;- Park.&#xa;- Pollen!&#xa;- Flowers.&#xa;- Repollination!&#xa;- Across the nation!&#xa;Tournament of Roses,&#xa;Pasadena, Oalifornia.&#xa;They&apos;ve got nothing&#xa;but flowers, floats and cotton candy.&#xa;Security will be tight.&#xa;I have an idea.&#xa;Vanessa Bloome, FTD.&#xa;Official floral business. It&apos;s real.&#xa;Sorry, ma&apos;am. Nice brooch.&#xa;Thank you. It was a gift.&#xa;Once inside,&#xa;we just pick the right float.&#xa;How about The Princess and the Pea?&#xa;I could be the princess,&#xa;and you could be the pea!&#xa;Yes, I got it.&#xa;- Where should I sit?&#xa;- What are you?&#xa;- I believe I&apos;m the pea.&#xa;- The pea?&#xa;It goes under the mattresses.&#xa;- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.&#xa;- I&apos;m getting the marshal.&#xa;You do that!&#xa;This whole parade is a fiasco!&#xa;Let&apos;s see what this baby&apos;ll do.&#xa;Hey, what are you doing?!&#xa;Then all we do&#xa;is blend in with traffic...&#xa;...without arousing suspicion.&#xa;Once at the airport,&#xa;there&apos;s no stopping us.&#xa;Stop! Security.&#xa;- You and your insect pack your float?&#xa;- Yes.&#xa;Has it been&#xa;in your possession the entire time?&#xa;Would you remove your shoes?&#xa;- Remove your stinger.&#xa;- It&apos;s part of me.&#xa;I know. Just having some fun.&#xa;Enjoy your flight.&#xa;Then if we&apos;re lucky, we&apos;ll have&#xa;just enough pollen to do the job.&#xa;Oan you believe how lucky we are? We&#xa;have just enough pollen to do the job!&#xa;I think this is gonna work.&#xa;It&apos;s got to work.&#xa;Attention, passengers,&#xa;this is Oaptain Scott.&#xa;We have a bit of bad weather&#xa;in New York.&#xa;It looks like we&apos;ll experience&#xa;a couple hours delay.&#xa;Barry, these are cut flowers&#xa;with no water. They&apos;ll never make it.&#xa;I gotta get up there&#xa;and talk to them.&#xa;Be careful.&#xa;Oan I get help&#xa;with the Sky Mall magazine?&#xa;I&apos;d like to order the talking&#xa;inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.&#xa;Oaptain, I&apos;m in a real situation.&#xa;- What&apos;d you say, Hal?&#xa;- Nothing.&#xa;Bee!&#xa;Don&apos;t freak out! My entire species...&#xa;What are you doing?&#xa;- Wait a minute! I&apos;m an attorney!&#xa;- Who&apos;s an attorney?&#xa;Don&apos;t move.&#xa;Oh, Barry.&#xa;Good afternoon, passengers.&#xa;This is your captain.&#xa;Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B&#xa;please report to the cockpit?&#xa;And please hurry!&#xa;What happened here?&#xa;There was a DustBuster,&#xa;a toupee, a life raft exploded.&#xa;One&apos;s bald, one&apos;s in a boat,&#xa;they&apos;re both unconscious!&#xa;- Is that another bee joke?&#xa;- No!&#xa;No one&apos;s flying the plane!&#xa;This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.&#xa;What&apos;s your status?&#xa;This is Vanessa Bloome.&#xa;I&apos;m a florist from New York.&#xa;Where&apos;s the pilot?&#xa;He&apos;s unconscious,&#xa;and so is the copilot.&#xa;Not good. Does anyone onboard&#xa;have flight experience?&#xa;As a matter of fact, there is.&#xa;- Who&apos;s that?&#xa;- Barry Benson.&#xa;From the honey trial?! Oh, great.&#xa;Vanessa, this is nothing more&#xa;than a big metal bee.&#xa;It&apos;s got giant wings, huge engines.&#xa;I can&apos;t fly a plane.&#xa;- Why not? Isn&apos;t John Travolta a pilot?&#xa;- Yes.&#xa;How hard could it be?&#xa;Wait, Barry!&#xa;We&apos;re headed into some lightning.&#xa;This is Bob Bumble. We have some&#xa;late-breaking news from JFK Airport,&#xa;where a suspenseful scene&#xa;is developing.&#xa;Barry Benson,&#xa;fresh from his legal victory...&#xa;That&apos;s Barry!&#xa;...is attempting to land a plane,&#xa;loaded with people, flowers&#xa;and an incapacitated flight crew.&#xa;Flowers?!&#xa;We have a storm in the area&#xa;and two individuals at the controls&#xa;with absolutely no flight experience.&#xa;Just a minute.&#xa;There&apos;s a bee on that plane.&#xa;I&apos;m quite familiar with Mr. Benson&#xa;and his no-account compadres.&#xa;They&apos;ve done enough damage.&#xa;But isn&apos;t he your only hope?&#xa;Technically, a bee&#xa;shouldn&apos;t be able to fly at all.&#xa;Their wings are too small...&#xa;Haven&apos;t we heard this a million times?&#xa;&quot;The surface area of the wings&#xa;and body mass make no sense.&quot;&#xa;- Get this on the air!&#xa;- Got it.&#xa;- Stand by.&#xa;- We&apos;re going live.&#xa;The way we work may be a mystery to you.&#xa;Making honey takes a lot of bees&#xa;doing a lot of small jobs.&#xa;But let me tell you about a small job.&#xa;If you do it well,&#xa;it makes a big difference.&#xa;More than we realized.&#xa;To us, to everyone.&#xa;That&apos;s why I want to get bees&#xa;back to working together.&#xa;That&apos;s the bee way!&#xa;We&apos;re not made of Jell-O.&#xa;We get behind a fellow.&#xa;- Black and yellow!&#xa;- Hello!&#xa;Left, right, down, hover.&#xa;- Hover?&#xa;- Forget hover.&#xa;This isn&apos;t so hard.&#xa;Beep-beep! Beep-beep!&#xa;Barry, what happened?!&#xa;Wait, I think we were&#xa;on autopilot the whole time.&#xa;- That may have been helping me.&#xa;- And now we&apos;re not!&#xa;So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.&#xa;All of you, let&apos;s get&#xa;behind this fellow! Move it out!&#xa;Move out!&#xa;Our only chance is if I do what I&apos;d do,&#xa;you copy me with the wings of the plane!&#xa;Don&apos;t have to yell.&#xa;I&apos;m not yelling!&#xa;We&apos;re in a lot of trouble.&#xa;It&apos;s very hard to concentrate&#xa;with that panicky tone in your voice!&#xa;It&apos;s not a tone. I&apos;m panicking!&#xa;I can&apos;t do this!&#xa;Vanessa, pull yourself together.&#xa;You have to snap out of it!&#xa;You snap out of it.&#xa;You snap out of it.&#xa;- You snap out of it!&#xa;- You snap out of it!&#xa;- You snap out of it!&#xa;- You snap out of it!&#xa;- You snap out of it!&#xa;- You snap out of it!&#xa;- Hold it!&#xa;- Why? Oome on, it&apos;s my turn.&#xa;How is the plane flying?&#xa;I don&apos;t know.&#xa;Hello?&#xa;Benson, got any flowers&#xa;for a happy occasion in there?&#xa;The Pollen Jocks!&#xa;They do get behind a fellow.&#xa;- Black and yellow.&#xa;- Hello.&#xa;All right, let&apos;s drop this tin can&#xa;on the blacktop.&#xa;Where? I can&apos;t see anything. Oan you?&#xa;No, nothing. It&apos;s all cloudy.&#xa;Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.&#xa;- Thinking bee.&#xa;- Thinking bee.&#xa;Thinking bee!&#xa;Thinking bee! Thinking bee!&#xa;Wait a minute.&#xa;I think I&apos;m feeling something.&#xa;- What?&#xa;- I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s strong, pulling me.&#xa;Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.&#xa;Bring the nose down.&#xa;Thinking bee!&#xa;Thinking bee! Thinking bee!&#xa;- What in the world is on the tarmac?&#xa;- Get some lights on that!&#xa;Thinking bee!&#xa;Thinking bee! Thinking bee!&#xa;- Vanessa, aim for the flower.&#xa;- OK.&#xa;Out the engines. We&apos;re going in&#xa;on bee power. Ready, boys?&#xa;Affirmative!&#xa;Good. Good. Easy, now. That&apos;s it.&#xa;Land on that flower!&#xa;Ready? Full reverse!&#xa;Spin it around!&#xa;- Not that flower! The other one!&#xa;- Which one?&#xa;- That flower.&#xa;- I&apos;m aiming at the flower!&#xa;That&apos;s a fat guy in a flowered shirt.&#xa;I mean the giant pulsating flower&#xa;made of millions of bees!&#xa;Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.&#xa;Rotate around it.&#xa;- This is insane, Barry!&#xa;- This&apos;s the only way I know how to fly.&#xa;Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane&#xa;flying in an insect-like pattern?&#xa;Get your nose in there. Don&apos;t be afraid.&#xa;Smell it. Full reverse!&#xa;Just drop it. Be a part of it.&#xa;Aim for the center!&#xa;Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!&#xa;Oome on, already.&#xa;Barry, we did it!&#xa;You taught me how to fly!&#xa;- Yes. No high-five!&#xa;- Right.&#xa;Barry, it worked!&#xa;Did you see the giant flower?&#xa;What giant flower? Where? Of course&#xa;I saw the flower! That was genius!&#xa;- Thank you.&#xa;- But we&apos;re not done yet.&#xa;Listen, everyone!&#xa;This runway is covered&#xa;with the last pollen&#xa;from the last flowers&#xa;available anywhere on Earth.&#xa;That means this is our last chance.&#xa;We&apos;re the only ones who make honey,&#xa;pollinate flowers and dress like this.&#xa;If we&apos;re gonna survive as a species,&#xa;this is our moment! What do you say?&#xa;Are we going to be bees, orjust&#xa;Museum of Natural History keychains?&#xa;We&apos;re bees!&#xa;Keychain!&#xa;Then follow me! Except Keychain.&#xa;Hold on, Barry. Here.&#xa;You&apos;ve earned this.&#xa;Yeah!&#xa;I&apos;m a Pollen Jock! And it&apos;s a perfect&#xa;fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.&#xa;Oh, yeah.&#xa;That&apos;s our Barry.&#xa;Mom! The bees are back!&#xa;If anybody needs&#xa;to make a call, now&apos;s the time.&#xa;I got a feeling we&apos;ll be&#xa;working late tonight!&#xa;Here&apos;s your change. Have a great&#xa;afternoon! Oan I help who&apos;s next?&#xa;Would you like some honey with that?&#xa;It is bee-approved. Don&apos;t forget these.&#xa;Milk, cream, cheese, it&apos;s all me.&#xa;And I don&apos;t see a nickel!&#xa;Sometimes I just feel&#xa;like a piece of meat!&#xa;I had no idea.&#xa;Barry, I&apos;m sorry.&#xa;Have you got a moment?&#xa;Would you excuse me?&#xa;My mosquito associate will help you.&#xa;Sorry I&apos;m late.&#xa;He&apos;s a lawyer too?&#xa;I was already a blood-sucking parasite.&#xa;All I needed was a briefcase.&#xa;Have a great afternoon!&#xa;Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,&#xa;and I can&apos;t get them anywhere.&#xa;No problem, Vannie.&#xa;Just leave it to me.&#xa;You&apos;re a lifesaver, Barry.&#xa;Oan I help who&apos;s next?&#xa;All right, scramble, jocks!&#xa;It&apos;s time to fly.&#xa;Thank you, Barry!&#xa;That bee is living my life!&#xa;Let it go, Kenny.&#xa;- When will this nightmare end?!&#xa;- Let it all go.&#xa;- Beautiful day to fly.&#xa;- Sure is.&#xa;Between you and me,&#xa;I was dying to get out of that office.&#xa;You have got&#xa;to start thinking bee, my friend.&#xa;- Thinking bee!&#xa;- Me?&#xa;Hold it. Let&apos;s just stop&#xa;for a second. Hold it.&#xa;I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m sorry, everyone.&#xa;Oan we stop here?&#xa;I&apos;m not making a major life decision&#xa;during a production number!&#xa;All right. Take ten, everybody.&#xa;Wrap it up, guys.&#xa;I had virtually no rehearsal for that."/>
